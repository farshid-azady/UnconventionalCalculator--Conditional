# UnconventionalCalculator--Conditional
in this second Project I decided To update The UnconventionalCalculator that I Wrote Before .But with Conditional statement.
guise Please Notice This is step by step Learning But with Real Project instesd of  Raw code with theoritical teach in this Project You Can see Before And After
Of the Project Growing, You Can See How Much your Code Mych More Cleaner look at this on the bottom:
this code is before conditional statement:
function subtract() {
     const enteredNumber = getUserNumberInput();
     const initialresult = currentResult;
    currentResult -= enteredNumber;
     createAndWriteOutput("-", initialresult, enteredNumber);
     writeToLog("SUBTRACT", enteredNumber, initialresult, currentResult);
}

and this is Code After adding The Conditional State on To this project:

function subtract() {
	// After Conditional statement Added To Project :UnconventionalCalculator.
	calculateResult("SUBTRACT");
	
}
5 lines were minimized from the cod and the code would be Cleaner and Faster And Easy To Read And Understand.
The first Project's Name is :UnconventionalCalculator
The Second project's Name is :UnconventionalCalculator-Conditional
Notice: All the Points of Intermediate and primitive JAVASCRIPT CODE are Defined in this Project To Easy Understan.

At the END:Please Please think and to analyze as a Programmer No as a STUDENT.
WELL COME TO REAL WORLD.
